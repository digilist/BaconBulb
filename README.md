BaconBulb
=========

Hit the bulbs with bacon.

This game is our contribution to the BaconGameJam05 (bacongamejam.org). It was our first experience with game development, so this game is very simple.

Everything you can see here, has been build in under 48h.

The game needs python3 and python3-sfml installed. Run it with `./main.py`
